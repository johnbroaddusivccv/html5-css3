        Welcome to my presentation pertaining to what my free coursework will be
        about. I will be uploading to youtube, so all may learn for free. Learn
        Version Control (Git Bash), Hyper-Text-Mark-Up Language (HTML5),
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3), and the Basics of JavaScript (JS).

      <h1>Why Should I learn Version Control? (Git Bash || Github)</h1>
      <p>
        Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of
        tracking and managing changes to software code. It is important to learn
        first, in my opinion, because you can track your growth and development
        through git repositories. Think of git as the bank teller, gitub as the
        bank, and you yourself as the customer. We have code on our machine
        right? we want to put it in a safe place just in case something happens
        to our machine and also while we are happy with the growth and
        development of our code. Git allows us to do this, when using git syntax
        we are communicating with github from our machine. We are telling github
        with git that we would like to make a deposit of code. The same works
        for withdrawing. When using git syntax we can withdraw our code as well.
        My coursework includes a step by step process similar to what a
        university coding boot camp would have you do before showing up to the
        first day of class. I run you through installation and usage so you can
        better understand version control and use it to the best of your
        ability.

      <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
      <p>
        Learning HTML is the foundation of what you are going to be doing.
        Advanced programming logic and reasoning does not come easily to
        everyone. In fact, very few people I have seen in my years of doing this
        that just understand the nature of everything going on.
        Hyper-Text-Mark-Up Language can be compared to a newspaper. While
        looking at a newspaper we see structure writing and organization. There
        are heading paragraphs and images on the page of a newspaper. HTML is
        the heading, paragraphs, structure, images, ect. of the web browser.

      <h1>Learning CSS</h1>
      <p>
        Learning the basics of CSS is vital to understanding why webpages look
        the way that they look. In the previous section we compared HTML to the
        headings, paragraphs, structure, images, ect. of the web browser. CSS
        can also be compared to a newpaper but CSS is a style sheet language. It
        is what makes webpages look the way that they look. an HTML file will
        reach out to a CSS file and they together in union to become a web page
        full of life. So hypothetically CSS is what makes the newspaper look the
        way that it looks. If there is red ink on a section in a paragraph this
        would be the works of Cascading Style Sheets. The words style sheets may
        be self explanatory but the same may not be for the word cascading. It
        is reffered to as cascading because the browser will read the file from
        top to bottom. The word cascade can mean a waterfall. As the water
        falls, from top to bottom, that is how the web browser reads CSS files.
